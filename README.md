## 🔬 Notebooks for Model Training

| Notebook | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `1-brain tumor detection.ipynb` | Trains a ResNet-based model to classify MRI scans as Tumor or No Tumor |
| `2-Segmentation.ipynb`   | Trains a U-Net model to perform tumor segmentation on MRI scans |

## 🎯 Features

- 🧠 **Classification**: Detects if the MRI image contains a brain tumor.
- 🎨 **Segmentation**: If a tumor exists, shows a segmented mask and an overlay.
- 📤 Easy image upload interface via Streamlit.
- 📈 Trained using high-performance models and optimized datasets.
